**Hacker Rank Coding Challenge: Median Analysis**
https://youtu.be/CYrAWWBHGso

Given an array arr of n integers, for each index i, find the length of the longest odd length subsequence of the array such that arr[i] is the median of the array and the number of distinct elements in the
subsequence less than arr[i] is equal to the number of distinct elements in the subsequence greater than arr[i].

Note: A subsequence of an array is defined as an array obtained after deleting zero or more elements of the given array. Also, the median of an array with an odd number of elements is defined as **the middle element obtained when the array is sorted**.
